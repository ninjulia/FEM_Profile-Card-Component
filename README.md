## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I leveraged flexbox for this, which allowed me to quickly center the card within the body in addition to aligning the "stats" evenly across the bottom of the card. 

### Continued development

The background image features on the card container, however, proved to be a challenge.  I was able to get them aligned to spec in mobile, or desktop, but not both.  I am looking forward to seeing how other people who submitted to this challenge achieved the design.
